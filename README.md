## Brief

This project is based on the obtained knowledge in Quantitatives Finances. During this subject we downloaded AMZN options so we could simulate hedgings using greeks. In our case we will be using call options in order tu simulate a company that specializes in selling them.

### Theory 

Financial Greeks, also known as option Greeks, are a set of metrics used to measure the sensitivity of the price of an option to various factors, such as changes in the price of the underlying asset, time decay, and changes in volatility.

There are five main financial Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho.

Delta measures the change in the price of an option relative to the change in the price of the underlying asset.

Gamma measures the rate of change of Delta with respect to changes in the price of the underlying asset.

Theta measures the rate at which the option's value declines over time as the option approaches its expiration date.

Vega measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in volatility in the underlying asset.

Rho measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in interest rates.

By using these metrics, traders and investors can better understand the risks and potential rewards of buying or selling options and can make more informed decisions about their investment strategies.

A call option is a financial contract between a buyer and a seller that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specific underlying asset at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, on or before a specific date, known as the expiration date.

When an investor buys a call option, they are essentially making a bet that the price of the underlying asset will increase. If the price of the underlying asset goes up, the buyer of the call option can exercise their right to buy the asset at the lower strike price, and then immediately sell it on the open market at the higher market price, pocketing the difference as profit.
